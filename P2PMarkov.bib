abstract = {Propagation of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) worms in the Internet is posing a serious challenge to network security research because of P2P worms' increasing complexity and sophistication. Due to the complexity of the problem, no existing work has solved the problem of modeling the propagation of P2P worms, especially when quarantine of peers is enforced. This paper presents a study on modeling the propagation of P2P worms. It also presents our applications of the proposed approach in worm propagation research. Motivated by our aspiration to invent an easy-to-employ instrument for worm propagation research, the proposed approach models the propagation processes of P2P worms by difference equations of a logic matrix, which are essentially discrete-time deterministic propagation models of P2P worms. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a logic matrix in network security research in general and worm propagation modeling in particular. Our major contributions in this paper are firstly, we propose a novel logic matrix approach to modeling the propagation of P2P worms under three different conditions; secondly, we find the impacts of two different topologies on a P2P worm's attack performance; thirdly, we find the impacts of the network-related characteristics on a P2P worm's attack performance in structured P2P networks; and fourthly, we find the impacts of the two different quarantine tactics on the propagation characteristics of P2P worms in unstructured P2P networks. The approach's ease of employment, which is demonstrated by its applications in our simulation experiments, makes it an attractive instrument to conduct worm propagation research.},

@article{Mihaita2015,
abstract = {In the last years, the number of vehicles has increased up to a point where the road infrastructure cannot easily cope anymore, and congestion in cities becomes the norm rather then exception. Smart technologies are vastly employed to cope with advanced scheduling mechanisms - from intelligent traffic lights designed to control traffic, up to applications running inside the car to provide updated information to the driver, or simply keep him socially connected. The time for such smart technologies is right: the power of computation along with the memory size of microprocessors have increased, while price per computation, storage and networking power decreased. What few years ago might have sounded rather futuristic, like technologies designed to facilitate communication between cars and automate the exchange of data about traffic, accidents or congestion, is now becoming reality. But the implications of these ideas have only recently become relevant; in particular, security and trust-related implications are just now arising as critical topics for such new applications. The reason is that drivers face new challenges, from their personal data being stolen or applications being fed with false information about traffic conditions, to technology being exposed to all kind of hijacking attacks. A practitioner developing a smart traffic application is faced with an important problem: what security technology or algorithm to use to better cope with these challenges. In this paper, we first present an analysis of various cryptographic algorithms in the context of vehicular scenarios. Our scope is to analyze the designs and approaches for securing networks formed between vehicles. In particular, we are interested in the security layers able to provide strong cryptographic algorithms implementation that can guarantee high levels of trust and security for vehicular applications. The analysis exploits the realistic simulator being developed at the University Politehnica of Bucharest.},

abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are distributed systems where no central authority rules the behavior of the individual peers. A typical application is the sharing of files of some class (movies, music, ...), our object of interest here. These systems relay on the voluntary participation of the peers to help each other. However, it is not uncommon to find users that have initiated a file transfer and decide to leave the system before the end of the download. This is a particularly harmful behavior due to the resources, such as bandwidth or energy, wasted in such an aborted process. This negative effect is amplified when the system's conditions are such that the peers are not downloading at the maximum capacity, i.e., the downloading bandwidth is underutilized. This is because in these conditions, there are not enough peers uploading the file, and a part of the bandwidth is wasted on peers that do not share their resources to the network once they leave the system. In this paper, a priority scheme is presented for a BitTorrentbased P2P network where the peers that are more likely to remain longer in the system are served first, over peers that are statistically more likely to abort the download. By giving priority to peers that are likely to go through the complete file download, the successful download rate for the peers that remain longer in the system is increased and the resources of the system are better utilized. The proposed scheme is analyzed by means of different models, in order to find the steady-state performance of the network. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are distributed systems where no central authority rules the behavior of the individual peers. These systems rely on the voluntary participation of the peers to help each other and reduce congestion at the data servers. BitTorrent is a popular file-sharing P2P application originally designed for non real-time data. With minor modifications concerning the peer selection among others, it can also be used for real-time applications. One major issue that impacts the performance of these networks is related to the fact that it is not uncommon to find users that have initiated a file transfer and decide to leave the system before the end of the download or when seeds leave the system shortly after downloading the complete file. In this work, a priority-based scheme for streaming stored playback video-on-demand services in window-based peers selection strategy in P2P networks is proposed. The priority scheme benefits the peers that are more likely to remain longer in the system by serving them first over peers that are statistically more likely to abort the download. The window-based peer selection strategy allows an efficient mechanism to select the downloader peers according to their progress in the file download process relative to the progress of the downloading peers. The aforementioned strategy is analyzed using both a fluid model and a Continuous Time Markov Chain. Also, abundance conditions in the system are identified. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

We tackle the issue of Sybil attacks from two sides. First, we clarify, analyze, and classify the P2P identifier assignment process. By clearly separating network participants from network nodes, two challenges of P2P networks under a Sybil attack become obvious: i) stability over time, and ii) identity differentiation. Second, as a starting point for a quantitative analysis of time-stability of P2P networks under Sybil attacks and under some assumptions with respect to identity differentiation, we propose an identity registration procedure called self-registration that makes use of the inherent distribution mechanisms of a P2P network. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

This trust management based on one-way authentication has few effects in reducing denial-of-service attacks of malicious consumers and free riding of selfish peers. In this paper, we introduce mutual authentication to P2P trust management and propose a trust model based on mutual authentication (MA model). The model is built on two kinds of authentication mechanism: server and consumer authenticcation mechanism. Server authentication mechanism is used to identify malicious servers, and consumer authentication mechanism is employed to handle requests from consumers. The implementation strategies of MA model are also described. The simulation shows that MA model is more effective on suppressing malicious servers and consumers, or even encouraging selfish peers to share their resources. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

In a mobile environment, users experience different channel conditions. This has a major impact on the system's performance as it is perceived by users in different coverage zones. Additionally, users have different degrees of mobility which can improve or degrade the quality of the received signal. In this work, a wireless mobile P2P network is studied. Building on this, two different scenarios are considered. Namely, a WLAN environment where nodes usually know the placement of the access point and can move closer to it in order to improve their channel quality and a cellular system where nodes usually do not know where their attending base station is located. Building on this, a priority model to improve the system's performance is proposed, studied and analyzed. This priority scheme is based on serving first users that experience a better channel condition in order to improve the file downloading process. The aforementioned networks are analyzed using both a fluid model and a Continuous Time Markov Chain.},

In the index poisoning attack, the attacker inserts massive numbers of bogus records into the index for a set of targeted titles. As a result, when a user searches for a targeted title, the index returns bogus results, such as bogus file identifiers, bogus IP addresses, or bogus port numbers. In this paper we first show that both structured and unstructured P2P file-sharing systems are highly vulnerable to the index poisoning attack. We then develop a novel and efficient methodology for estimating index poisoning levels and pollution levels in file-sharing systems. The methodology is efficient in that involves neither the downloading nor the analysis of binary content files. We deploy data-harvesting platforms for FastTrack, an unstructured file-sharing system, and Overnet, a DHT-based file-sharing system. Applying our methodology to harvested data, we find that index poisoning is pervasive in both systems. We also outline a distributed blacklisting procedure for countering the index poisoning and pollution attacks. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

This classification easily allows identifying peers that are able to share windows among them, so one of our major contributions is the definition of a mechanism that could be implemented to efficiently distribute video content in future 5G networks. Considering that cooperation among peers can be insufficient to guarantee an appropriate system performance, we also propose that this network must be assisted by upload bandwidth from servers; since these resources represent an extra cost to the service provider, especially in mobile networks, we complement our work by defining a scheme that efficiently allocates them only to those peers that are in windows with resources scarcity (we called it prioritized windows distribution scheme). On the basis of a fluid model and a Markov chain, we also developed a methodology that allows us to select the system parameters values (e.g., windows sizes or minimum servers upload bandwidth) that satisfy a set of Quality of Experience (QoE) parameters.},

Moreover, due to the inherent characteristics of wireless networks, the existing identity authentication schemes proposed for the traditional P2P networks are not suited for wireless P2P. Hence, we propose an identity authentication scheme for the wireless P2P network in this paper. In the proposed scheme, we apply a hybrid P2P topology and tickets issued by super peers to perform the user mutual authentication. And we also present a quick re-authentication method dealing with temporary broken down link to simplify the authentication procedure and improve the efficiency. Security analysis results show that our proposed scheme can resist most malicious attacks effectively. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are distributed systems where no central authority rules the behavior of the individual peers. These systems rely on the voluntary participation of the peers to help each other and reduce congestion at the data servers. BitTorrent is a popular file-sharing P2P application originally designed for non real-time data. With minor modifications concerning the peer selection among others, it can also be used for real-time applications. One major issue that impacts the performance of these networks is related to the fact that it is not uncommon to find users that have initiated a file transfer and decide to leave the system before the end of the download or when seeds leave the system shortly after downloading the complete file. In this work, a priority-based scheme for streaming stored playback video-on-demand services in window-based peers selection strategy in P2P networks is proposed. The priority scheme benefits the peers that are more likely to remain longer in the system by serving them first over peers that are statistically more likely to abort the download. The window-based peer selection strategy allows an efficient mechanism to select the downloader peers according to their progress in the file download process relative to the progress of the downloading peers. The aforementioned strategy is analyzed using both a fluid model and a Continuous Time Markov Chain. Also, abundance conditions in the system are identified. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are distributed systems where no central authority rules the behavior of the individual peers. A typical application is the sharing of files of some class (movies, music, ...), our object of interest here. These systems relay on the voluntary participation of the peers to help each other. However, it is not uncommon to find users that have initiated a file transfer and decide to leave the system before the end of the download. This is a particularly harmful behavior due to the resources, such as bandwidth or energy, wasted in such an aborted process. This negative effect is amplified when the system's conditions are such that the peers are not downloading at the maximum capacity, i.e., the downloading bandwidth is underutilized. This is because in these conditions, there are not enough peers uploading the file, and a part of the bandwidth is wasted on peers that do not share their resources to the network once they leave the system. In this paper, a priority scheme is presented for a BitTorrentbased P2P network where the peers that are more likely to remain longer in the system are served first, over peers that are statistically more likely to abort the download. By giving priority to peers that are likely to go through the complete file download, the successful download rate for the peers that remain longer in the system is increased and the resources of the system are better utilized. The proposed scheme is analyzed by means of different models, in order to find the steady-state performance of the network. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

In the proposed scheme, that we have called Prioritized-Windows Distribution (PWD), the amount of seeders' resources assigned to a peer depends on its current progress in the process of downloading a video which is divided into ordered fragments (windows). We demonstrate through a fluid model analysis and Markov chain numerical evaluations that PWD improves the P2P network performance in terms of the level of cooperation that is required from seeders to keep the system under abundance conditions. Additionally, we analyze the performance of the system as a function of two parameters that highly influence the Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the users, namely, the initial playback delay and the time required to download the video. Our results show that PWD outperforms previous proposals.},

abstract = {Due to the global increase in mobile devices and cellular networks such as 3G, 4G, or LTE-A networks, the concept of the interpenetration of peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks in cellular environments has gained immense popularity among mobile users. P2P networks allow users to share their computing resources efficiently with the advantages of fault tolerance, robust connectivity, load balancing, and easy maintenance. The ability of a peer to connect to another peer depends on the distinguishing features of the overlay networks. For connection, network routing tables are maintained by each peer in the network to construct the P2P overlay on the Internet. This construction renders the P2P networks vulnerable to the existing attacks using the Internet. Some of these attack models have been proposed in the past using botnets. However, models using botnets do not accommodate the advanced attacks that can infect the majority of the entries in the routing table. In this paper, we propose a model to analyze the impacts of routing table poisoning attacks on the P2P botnet (rBot) architecture. We present the security analysis of the proposed epidemic model for state-of-the-art rBots. The obtained results were effective for attacks on the unstructured P2P static and mobile environments.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of peer-to-peer network security. Popular for sharing of multimedia files, these networks carry risks and vulnerabilities relating to data integrity, spyware, adware, and unwanted files. Further attacks include those of forgery, pollution, repudiation, membership and Eclipse attacks, neighbor selection attacks, Sybil, DoS, and omission attacks. We review some protection mechanisms that have been devised. Introduction Most information transferred on the internet utilizes a server/client communication protocol, where one high performance machine services the requests of multiple lower performance machines. These lower performance machines have identities that the server can recognize, allowing a safe transaction to occur [1]. Unlike server/client networks, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks consist of nodes, or users, who behave like both server and client, able to simultaneously request information and provide information to other nodes. P2P nodes have aptly been dubbed Servents, taking half of the word server and half of the word client [1]. Not only can nodes within a P2P network both send and receive data, they can also share resources such as processing power, storage, peripherals, and network capacity [1]. P2P networks became popular after the emergence of Napster, an early application that allowed users to share music with other users. It utilized a hybrid P2P network where there was a central server that allowed users to search for music and then multiple users would contribute percentages of the file being searched for [2]. The P2P model is convenient because of its classical ability to search for files throughout the network, using a semi-centralized server; however, as it will be shown, any form of centralized node grouping can leave the whole network vulnerable to attacks. Along with hybrid P2P networks there are also " pure " P2P networks, which do not have any centralized nodes, and all file transfers happen between users. Streaming P2P services suffer additional attacks such as data pollution that affects QoS, or data outage by the use of Eclipse, Sybil and neighbor selection attacks. This is done by attacking the routing substrate of the P2P network which is based normally on distributed hash tables [3].},

We focus on the feature that a peer bot generates multiple traffic to communicate with large number of remote peers. In this case, phased botnet flows have similar patterns, which occur at irregular intervals. We compress duplicated flows via flow grouping and construct a transition model of the clustered flows using a probability-based matrix. A flow state is decided by features consisting of; protocol, port, and traffic. Our model involves transition information about the state values. Finally, we use the likelihood ratio for detection. In the experimental evaluation, we show the efficiency of our proposed system with the SpamThru, Storm, and Nugache botnets. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},
